# Type Alias: pathPattern

> **pathPattern**: `string`

HTTP request paths, with optional wildcard support.

This type is designed to identify paths used in HTTP requests. It includes characters
commonly found in HTTP paths such as letters, numbers, '/', '+', '-', '_', '.',
URL-encoded characters like '%20', and the '*' character, which serves as an optional
wildcard to match the ends of strings.
